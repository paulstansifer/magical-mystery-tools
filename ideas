What tools would be useful for solving Mystery Hunt puzzles?

MMS (MagicalMysteryString)
  ;; A lazy collection of strings, sorted in descending likelihood
  
  -- .iter() -> Iter<string>;; iterate in order of likelihood
  -- .or(m: MMS) -> MMS ;; combine MMSes
  -- .has_index() -> bool 
  -- .index() -> MMS ;; probably not always possible
  -- .dedup() -> MMS ;; combine duplicate entries and sum their frequencies (nonlazy!)
  -- .map(...) -> MMS 
  -- .filter(...) -> MMS 
  -- .duplicate(...) -> MMS ;; like .filter(...), but can increase the number of occurrences, too
  -- .probabilistic_filter(...) -> MMS ;; adjust frequencies (downward-only to make laziness still reasonable)
  -- .intersect(source: MMS) -> MMS ;; adjust frequencies based on how likely source would be to produce each component.
     ;; What you typically want is something like garbage_to_sort_though.intersect(3grams.star())
  -- .prob_mult(f: float) -> MMS ;; for combining with `or`
  -- .take_top(n: u32) -> MMS ;; restrict to the n best choices
  -- .take_with_min_freq(f: float) -> MMS ;; restrict to choices with frequency at least f
  -- .prob_of(s: string) -> float
  -- .has(s: string) -> bool
  -- .concat_style() -> PlainConcatenation | OverlapBy(n: u32) | OverlapAllBut(n: u32) ;; for example, a dictionary would be Plain, but ngrams are OverlapAllBut(1)
  -- .concat(m: MMS) -> MMS ;; cross product concatenation (respecting concat_style)
  -- .star(decline: float) -> MMS ;; produces infinite MMS of sequences, with n-length sequences being deline^n less likely
     ;; If there's overlap, respect the probability of that overlap.
     ;; Thus, running .star() on an ngram collection performs dissociated-press
  -- .shufflings() -> MMS ;; like .star, but uses each component exactly once. (So, impossibly large, but finite)
  -- .remove_similar(...) -> MMS ;; no idea how this works, but it'd be nice to filter down to significantly different results
  -- .flatten() -> MMS ;; (if finite) give everything equal probability
  -- .force() -> MMS ;; eagerly compute to a concrete representation
  
  
  
default MMSes
  -- SOWPODS
  -- alphabet_english
  -- characters_english
  -- google_2grams
  -- google_3grams (etc.)
  -- wikipedia_article_titles
  -- ngrams_without_word_boundaries
  
un_interleave(s: string) -> MMS ;; skips as little as possible of `s` to produce things with high scores
score(s:string, concat_source: MMS) -> float ;; how easy is `s` to make with `concat_source.star(1.0)`?
anagram(s:string) -> MMS 
stride_paths(s:string, stride: u32, obey_boundaries: bool) -> MMS ;; find the paths through `s` with the given stride (good for wordsearches)

To solve the Qwantzle:
anagram("ttttttttttttooooooooooeeeeeeeeaaaaaaallllllnnnnnnuuuuuuiiiiisssssdddddhhhhhyyyyyIIIrrrfffbbwwkcmvg")
  .shufflings().intersect(ngrams_without_word_boundaries).intersect(dino_comics_corpus);
